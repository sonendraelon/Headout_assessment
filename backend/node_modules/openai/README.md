> tl;dr: Please consider using [GPT-X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-x) instead

This package will be replaced soon by an official one from OpenAI. If you still want to use the unofficial version package, just switch to the new one called [GPT-X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-x), it will remain the same API for compatibility reasons.
